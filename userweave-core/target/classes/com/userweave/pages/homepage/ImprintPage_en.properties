link_disclaimer = <b>Link disclaimer</b><br/>In its judgement from 12 May 1998, the Regional Court of Hamburg decreed that the deployment of a link may incur responsibility in part for the content of the linked page. According to the Regional Court, this can only be prevented by explicitly dissociating oneself from these contents. We have provided links to other sites on the Internet. For all these links the following disclaimer therefore applies\: "We explicitly emphasize that we have absolutely no influence on the design and contents of the linked sites. For this reason, we hereby explicitly dissociate ourselves from the contents of all linked sites on our website and disclaim all responsibility for the contents of these sites. This statement applies to all links shown on our pages and to the contents of all pages that can be called up through these links."
